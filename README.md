# Induction to BadiaLab (work in progress)

# Initial steps
 1. Sign-in to [Github](https://github.com/) (i.e., create an account)
 2. Ask for invitation to [BadiaLab](https://github.com/BadiaLab) Github organization. How? Write an e-mail either to `alberto.martin@monash.edu` or `santiago.badia@monash.edu`

# Coding 

1. Follow the introduction to the Unix Shell tutorial. [here](https://github.com/MonashMath/SCI1022/blob/master/Unix-CLI.md) (if not familiarized)
2. Follow the introduction to version control with Git tutorial [here](https://github.com/MonashMath/SCI1022/blob/master/Git.md) (if not familiarized)
3. Install Julia. [here](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/wiki/Start-learning-Julia)
4. Introduction to Julia programming language [here](https://juliaacademy.com/p/intro-to-julia) . Free course, although you have to register before. Also it is a good resource the Julia documentation, but highly advanced! [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/)
5. Set up a development workflow (coding, testing, debugging, etc.) for Julia using Visual Studio Code. [here](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/wiki/Visual-Studio-Code-as-Julia-IDE). **VERY IMPORTANT**: Install `Revise.jl` Julia package early so that you can re-compile code dynamically while developing, without the need to close and re-open the Julia REPL. See [here](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/) for instructions needed for installing packages.

# Gridap.jl 

1. [Start learning Gridap](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/wiki/Start-learning-Gridap)

# Finite Elements 
 1. Ern & Guermond book.
 2. Santi's Lecture notes on Finite Element methods. MTH-4321, MTH-5321
 3. Gentle introduction to FEM Lecture notes [here](https://team-pancho.github.io/documents/anIntro2FEM_2015.pdf). Chapters 1-5.
 4. Claes Johnson book on Finite Elements. [here](https://www.booktopia.com.au/numerical-solution-of-partial-differential-equations-by-the-finite-element-method-claes-johnson/book/9780486469003.html?source=pla&gclid=CjwKCAiA78aNBhAlEiwA7B76pyECVNAow3Euugh0nZIWJ1C3O-n8rQAhK3GrEWuYJkErXaPqSvaMdhoCH1sQAvD_BwE)
 5. Imperial College FEM course. Available [here](https://finite-element.github.io/)

# Automated handling of bibliographics references 

Use the code available at the following repository: https://github.com/BadiaLab/BibHandler.jl

# HPC cluster (Monarch) for medium computational demands

(only when you need it)

1. Apply for an account. How? Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.monarch.erc.monash.edu/MonARCH/requesting-an-account.html). In step number 3., you have to join the `pMona0083` project.
2. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/gridap/GridapDistributed.jl/wiki/Monarch-(Monash)-Useful-links,-commands,-and-workflows)

# Writing technical documents (articles)

We have a LaTeX template [here](https://github.com/BadiaLab/induction/blob/main/assets/report.tex) that you can use to write your articles/reports.
